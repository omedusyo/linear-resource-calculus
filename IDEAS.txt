* You could add tagged operator. Then `#pair(20, 30)` would be syntactic sugar for `tagged pair (20, 3)`.
  This operator takes in a statically known tag value and a cartesian value, and produces a new cartesian value.
  So this is some sort of action on values...
  Also `(10, 20, 30, 40)` could be syntactic sugar for `tuple 10 20 30 40`.
  This `tuple` ofcourse must have fixed static size.
  What are these static tags? Could we generalize them as "static" parameters to functions?
  Some sort of limited form of macro?

  Maybe this should be
    tuple(10, 20, 30, 40) actually...
  or tag(foo, 123)
